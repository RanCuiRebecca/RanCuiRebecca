I have done one landing page(you should start your experience from here, and you can go to the product browsing page through the "See what we have" button), one product browsing page and 6 detailed product pages. In order to have the cart function in the detailed product page, I have also finished one cart.js. So, you can add items to the cart on the detailed product page, but I haven't finish the local storage function, so the shopping record cannot be recorded, which means when you jump to another page, the previous operation will be removed.
