\f0\fs24 \cf0 I have done one 
\b landing page(you should start your experience from here
\b0 , and you can go to the product browsing page through the "See what we have" button), one product browsing page and 6 detailed product pages. In order to have the cart function in the detailed product page, I have also finished one cart.js. So, you can add items to the cart on the detailed product page, but I haven't finish the local storage function, so the shopping record cannot be recorded, which means when you jump to another page, the previous operation will be removed.}
